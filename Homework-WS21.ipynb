    "# Task and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we want you to experience doing a mini-project in PyTorch. You are supposed to build the different parts of the pipeline as illustrated in the course notebooks (DataLoading, Model, Loss, Training, Evaluation). For this purpose, we will use a dataset from Quora containing question pairs and labels whether the pair is a duplicate or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data can be found in Moodle in a csv file. The data is This data is subject to Quora's [Terms of Service](https://www.quora.com/about/tos), allowing for non-commercial use. The dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/quora/question-pairs-dataset. \n"

    "**Classifiying Duplicate Question Pairs** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to build a DL Model that can predict whether two questions from a Quora dataset are duplicates or not. Note that the two questions must not be identical as you will see in the dataset, rather they semantically mean almost the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the setup a bit simpler, we extracted and prepared a small subset of the original data consisting of 50k examples. Additionally, we removed questions that are too long or too short, we kept questions of length between 30 and 50 characters. Those 50k examples should serve as training and validation data, please consider making a reasonable split. Do not train on the validation data, just use it to evaluate your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Inputs and Label**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Format: 2 questions, for each question you will have an input of `BATCH_SIZE X SEQ_LEN`, where SEQ_LEN is the number of tokens in the question. Of course, if you will stack the input into batches, you will need to pad the questions (i.e. add a padding token or zeros at the end of the question to make all questions equal in length).\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Format: `BATCH_SIZE X 1`, please note that the extra dimension (`X 1`) is optional and dependent on your implementaiton, you could have a simple 1D tensor of length `BATCH_SIZE`, where each value is either 0 or 1 indicating that the two questions are either non-duplicates or not, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please read the csv file and explore the dataset a bit in order to familize yourself with the problem before working on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In your custom DataLoader you have to make sure that you provide two questions for each example, this should be done in the `def __getitem__(self, idx)` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Please work at the word-level, your tokens are words. You will need to preprocess the data accordingly. Feel free to write simple Python code that can do the job, but also consider using tokenizers, stemmers, and lemmatizers from known NLP libraries such as [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) or [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You will need to encode the words into integers to be able to pass them to the model, you will also need to keep track of the vocabulary. For this purpose, you can also write your own Python code or use an out-of-the-box module such as `torchtext.data.vocab` (see example in the data loading notebook). You can include this part in your Dataset class if you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You will most probalby need to use an embedding layer as input to the model, it will then take the sequence of integers and return numeric vectors representing each word. Please consider using pre-trained embeddings, there are multiple ways how to load these into your newly-created Embedding layer, `torchtext` also provides some easy ways to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. With Embeddings, you will have two options:\n",
    "    - train your own embeddings on the task, either by starting from random weights or after loading pre-trained embeddings (this will take more time and probably need Colab or GPU)\n",
    "    - or freeze the pre-trained embeddings and train the rest of the network (make sure the embedding layer is frozen, `requires_grad` is set to `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Note that you will need to encode the questions as integers based on the vocabulary you are using. This sequence of integers will be fed as input to the model (embeddings lookup, then the following layers).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Take care that the model have two inputs (two sentences in parallel). This should be done in your implementation of the `def forward(self, question1, qustion2)` in your custom model class.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Since you need to feed both question to your model, in the `forward` you will have to let each question go through a couple of layers to get a representation for each question. Then, you will have to combine the two representations in any way you see possible (e.g. multiply them, subtract them, concatenate them). Finally, with this final representation, you will have to let it go through a couple of layers (mostly fully-connected layers) and then predict the outcome (2 classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. This is generally a binary classification problem, you can use a classification loss to train your model. There are more advanced loss functions that are related to Siamese Networks (which is this architecture since it has multiple parallel inputs), feel free to use or explore them.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. A nice lecture about the topic is here: Siamese Networks and Similarity Learning Lecture, Prof. Dr. Laura Leal-Taixé, Advanced Deep Learning for Computer Vision Course:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e65XfwmIWE\n",

If everything is confined in one single notebook, just submit the notebook.\n",
